this is very basic example on Python so it will go well
This document outlines several foundational Python programming exercises,
 designed to demonstrate core concepts in programming logic and operator usage.
 The source presents a series of solved problems, including finding the largest element among
 three numbers and displaying prime numbers within an interval, each accompanied by detailed code,
 step-by-step explanations, and clear output examples. A particularly insightful section illustrates how to swap
 two numbers without using a temporary variable through arithmetic manipulation. The text also provides an exhaustive
 demonstration of eight types of Python operators, such as Arithmetic, Relational, and Identity operators,
 before concluding with programs to manipulate complex numbers and generate a multiplication table.
